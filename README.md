SAP SE has a large portfolio of business application and analytics software, including cloud infrastructure, applications, and storage. 
### Self-development for thinking style and characteristics

- Memorizing more concepts, gaining more knowledge and thinking logically. It is an ability to recall technical facts about the systems and platforms, especially when using Linux Shell commands. Likewise, keeping in mind several specific facts about your particular environment (Do you operate in a LAN or WAN? What are the administrator passwords to the databases? How many users do you have? When is your next database audit? Where are your backups stored?) is crucial.
- Strong passionate to learn new knowledge. Since the IT filed is developing rapidly, the ability of learning keeps people's mind freash and gain new solutions when face problems.
### Get to learn more computer languages and try to participate in several competetions
- Structured query language, or SQL, is the standard for relational database management systems. Several versions of SQL exist, but all use the same basic command structure. Modern relational database management systems such as MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL and Microsoft Access are all based on SQL. Many database developers also learn Visual Basic and Java so they can write custom code to improve user interfaces.
- Participating in competetion can train the problemshooting ability and can reinforce the knowledge people currently have by doing challenge questions.
